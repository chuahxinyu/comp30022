The dashboard serves as the main entrypoint for the application. It provides a general overview of the information that is deemed important for a typical user. 

From the dashboard, a user can see:
1. Today's events
2. All Trello tasks
3. Connections

The dashboard also provides easy navigation to all the pages in the application.
